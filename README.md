# Random Forest Algorithm for Iris Flower Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code and information about using the Random Forest algorithm to analyze the famous Iris flower dataset. The Random Forest algorithm is a powerful ensemble learning technique widely used for classification tasks.

## Dataset
The Iris flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, representing three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It is known for its high accuracy, robustness, and ability to handle complex datasets.
